# Vercel Deployment Error Fix

## Problem
Error: The pattern "app/api/**/*.ts" defined in `functions` doesn't match any Serverless Functions inside the `api` directory.

## Root Cause
The `vercel.json` file was configured with a `functions` section that looked for serverless functions in `app/api/**/*.ts`, but this project:
- Uses Supabase Edge Functions (not Vercel Functions)
- Has no API routes in the `app/api/` directory
- Functions are located in `supabase/functions/` for Supabase deployment

## Solution Applied
✅ Removed the `functions` configuration from `vercel.json`
✅ Kept all other configurations (headers, redirects, rewrites)

## Why This Works
- This is a React frontend that connects to Supabase backend
- All serverless functions run on Supabase Edge Functions
- Vercel only needs to serve the static React build
- No Vercel serverless functions are required

## Next Steps
1. Commit the fixed `vercel.json`
2. Redeploy to Vercel - the error should be resolved
3. The deployment will now focus on building and serving the React app

## Environment Variables Still Needed
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
